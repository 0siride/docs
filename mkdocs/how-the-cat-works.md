# How the Cat works
The Cat is made of many components. Most of these are designed to be pluggable and customizable.

Here there is a short description of each component.
## Components

:material-chat-outline: `Chat`
:   This is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) component that allows you to directly interact with the Cat.

:rabbit: `Rabbit Hole`
:   This component handles the ingestion of document files.   
    Files that are sent down the *Rabbit Hole* are split into chunks and saved in the Cat's *episodic memory*. <link to episodic memory>

:brain: `Large Language Model (LLM)`
:   This is one of the core components of the Cheshire Cat framework. 
    A LMM is a Deep Learning model that's been trained on a huge volume of text data and can perform many types of language tasks.
