# Hello, dear!


## What is this?

If you want to build a custom AI on top of a language model, the Cat can help you:

- Language model agnostic (works with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace models, custom)
- Long term memory
- Can use external tools (APIs, custom python code, other models)
- Can ingest documents (.txt, .pdf)
- Extendible via [plugins](plugins/plugins.md) in Python
- 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

# Getting started

## Download
Clone the repository on your machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat.git
```

## Install
To run the Cheshire Cat, you need to have `docker` ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) and `docker-compose` ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)) installed on your system.

## Quickstart
For quick setup and make the Cat run using the `gpt3.5-turbo` [OpenAI model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), do the following:

- Create and API key with `+ Create new secret key` in your OpenAI [personal account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Create an `.env` file in the cloned repository
- Write your API key in the `.env` file (`OPENAI_KEY=past-key-here`)
- Start the app with `docker-compose up`
- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on `localhost:3000`.
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on `localhost:1865/docs`

The first time you run the `docker-compose up` command it will take several minutes as docker images occupy some GBs.

Here is a list of commands to achieve the aforementioned steps:

```bash
# Open the cloned repository
cd cheshire-cat

# Create new .env file and write OpenAI API key to it
echo "OPENAI_KEY=paste-key-here" > .env

# Run docker containers
docker-compose up
```
When you're done using the Cat, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and `docker-compose down`.

## Update
As the project is still a work in progress, if you want to update it run the following:
```bash
# Open the cloned repository
cd cheshire-cat

# Pull from the main remote repository
git pull

# Build again the docker containers
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Run docker containers
docker-compose up
```

### Custom code

!!! note

    If you plan to write [custom tools](plugins/plugins.md), remember to start your folders with two underscores to avoid conflict between the git repository and the local one.

# Which way to go from here?

    "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
    "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
    "I don't much care where--" said Alice.
    "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
