# Hello, dear!


## What is this?
The Cheshire Cat is an open-source framework that allows you to develop intelligent agents on top of many 
[Large Language Models](how-the-cat-works.md#components) (LMM).
You can develop your custom AI architecture to assist you in a wide range of tasks.

The Cheshire Cat embeds a [long-term memory](how-the-cat-works.md#components) system to save the user's input locally 
and answer informed by the context of previous conversations. 
You can also feed text documents in the Cat's memory system to enrich the agent's contextual information and ask it to 
retrieve them further in the conversation.
The Cat currently supports `.txt`, `.pdf` and `.md` files.

If you want the Cat to solve tailored tasks you can extend its capabilities writing Python [plugins](plugins/plugins.md)
to execute custom functions or call external services (e.g. APIs and other models).

#### Currently Available LLMs
This is the list of currently supported LMMs:

- GPT3
- ChatGPT
- Cohere
- HuggingFace Hub
- HuggingFace endpoints

If you want to build your custom AI architecture, the Cat can help you:

- :earth_africa: Language model agnostic
-  :elephant: Long term memory
- :tools: Can use external tools
- :material-file-document: Can ingest documents (.txt, .pdf)
- :rocket: Extendible via [plugins](plugins/plugins.md) in Python
- :whale2: 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting started

### Download
Clone the repository on your machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat.git
```

### Install
To run the Cheshire Cat, you need to have `docker` ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) and `docker-compose` ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)) installed on your system.

- Create and API key on the language model provider website  
- Create an `.env` file in the cloned repository
- Start the app with `docker-compose up` inside the repository
- Open the app in your browser at `localhost:3000`
- Configure a LLM in the `Settings` tab and paste you API key
- Start chatting

You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on `localhost:1865/docs`

The first time you run the `docker-compose up` command it will take several minutes as docker images occupy some GBs.

### Quickstart
Here is an example of a quick setup running the `gpt3.5-turbo` OpenAI [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5).  

Create an API key with `+ Create new secret key` in your OpenAI [personal account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), then:

#### CLI setup
=== "Linux & Mac"

    ```bash
    # Open the cloned repository
    cd cheshire-cat
    
    # Create empty .env file
    touch .env
    
    # Run docker containers
    docker-compose up
    ```
=== "Windows"
    
    ```bash
    # Open the cloned repository
    cd cheshire-cat
    
    # Create empty .env file
    type null > .env
    
    # Run docker containers
    docker-compose up
    ```

#### GUI setup

  <source src="assets/vid/setup.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</p>

    
When you're done using the Cat, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and `docker-compose down`.

### Update
As the project is still a work in progress, if you want to update it run the following:
```bash
# Open the cloned repository
cd cheshire-cat

# Pull from the main remote repository
git pull

# Build again the docker containers
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Run docker containers
docker-compose up
```

#### Custom code

!!! note

    If you plan to write [custom tools](plugins/plugins.md), remember to start your folders with two underscores to avoid conflict between the git repository and the local one.

# Which way to go from here?

    "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
    "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
    "I don't much care where--" said Alice.
    "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
