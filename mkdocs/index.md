# Hello, dear!


## What is this?

If you want to build a custom AI on top of a language model, the Cat can help you:

- Language model agnostic (works with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace models, custom)
- Long term memory
- Can use external tools (APIs, custom python code, other models)
- Can ingest documents (.txt, .pdf)
- Extendible via [plugins](plugins/plugins.md) in Python
- 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

# Getting started

## Download
To download the Cheshire Cat just clone the repository on your machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat.git
```

## Install
To run the Cheshire Cat, you need to have `docker` ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) and `docker-compose` ([instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)) installed on your system.

## Quickstart
To have a quick setup and make the Cheshire Cat run using the `gpt3.5-turbo` [OpenAI model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), do the following:
- Create and API key with `+ Create new secret key` in your OpenAI [person account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Create an `.env` file in the cloned repository
- Write your key in the `.env` file (`OPENAI_KEY=past-key-here`)
- Start the app with `docker-compose up`
- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on `localhost:3000`.
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on `localhost:1865/docs`

The first time you run the `docker-compose up` command it will take several minutes as docker images occupy some GBs.

Here is a list of commands to achieve the aforementioned steps.

```bash
# Move inside the cloned repository
cd cheshire-cat

# Create new .env file and write OpenAI API key to it
echo "OPENAI_KEY=paste-key-here" > .env

# Run docker containers
docker-compose up
```
When you're done, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and `docker-compose down`.

## Update
As the project is still a work in progress, if you want to update it run the following:
```bash
# Open the cloned repository
cd cheshire-cat

# Pull from the main remote repository
git pull

# Build again the docker containers
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Run docker containers
docker-compose up
```

## Roadmap

- QA / tests
- docs and tutorials
- online demo
- voice interface
- more plugins shipped by default
- (surprise!!!) PURR

## Contributing

    "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
    "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
    "I don't much care where--" said Alice.
    "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
